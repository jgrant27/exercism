# Bob

Bob is a lackadaisical teenager. In conversation, his responses are very limited.

Bob answers 'Sure.' if you ask him a question.

He answers 'Whoa, chill out!' if you yell at him.

He answers 'Calm down, I know what I'm doing!' if you yell a question at him.

He says 'Fine. Be that way!' if you address him without actually saying
anything.

He answers 'Whatever.' to anything else.

Bob's conversational partner is a purist when it comes to written communication and always follows normal rules regarding sentence punctuation in English.

## Version compatibility
Julia 1.0 and 0.7 are the only supported Julia versions on Exercism.
For the most part, the test suites and solutions should be compatible to 0.6, but you will have to change `using Test` back to `using Base.Test` in the `runtests.jl` file.
Note that 0.7 and 1.0 are almost identical, except for deprecation warnings, which have all been removed in 1.0.
